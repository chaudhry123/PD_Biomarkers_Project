## Variant plus Proteomic Models

### Description

*Comprehensive Collection for Proteomic Data Analysis: This repository houses a complete suite of scripts and code dedicated to analyzing proteomic data using advanced machine learning techniques.

*Three Distinct Machine Learning Models: The primary focus is on implementing three models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ridge Regression, and Neural Networks, each designed to handle the complexities of proteomic data.

*Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model: The SVM model leverages its ability to manage high-dimensional data and identify optimal hyperplanes for classification tasks, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.

*Ridge Regression Model: Ridge Regression is employed to address potential multicollinearity in the dataset, providing more reliable coefficient estimates for the proteomic data.

*Neural Networks: Neural Networks, known for capturing non-linear relationships, are utilized to model complex patterns inherent in proteomic data, offering a comprehensive evaluation of different modeling techniques.

*Detailed Preprocessing Scripts: The repository includes scripts for data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values and normalizing data distributions. These automated preprocessing steps ensure data quality and consistency, streamlining the workflow for researchers and facilitating model development and evaluation.

* The codebase is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy adaptation to new datasets or modifications to existing processing steps.

* We included instructions on how to set up the necessary environment to run the code, including information on required dependencies and how to install them. We recommend using virtual environments to isolate the dependencies for this project, ensuring compatibility and reproducibility across different systems.

### Executing program

To get started, run the raw proteomic data through the provided preprocessing scripts. These scripts are designed to handle tasks such as missing values and normalizing data distributions, ensuring the data is clean and consistent. Once the preprocessing is complete, the scripts will generate the necessary training, test, and validation files for each of the three models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ridge Regression, and Neural Networks. These preprocessed files are essential for the subsequent steps of model training and evaluation, allowing for a streamlined and efficient workflow.
