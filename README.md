In this project, we provide a comprehensive set of tools for data preprocessing and modeling. The preprocessing stage is detailed in the notebook titled "Preprocessing_olink.ipynb", last updated on May 20, 2024. This notebook covers all necessary data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformations required for our analysis. Subsequently, we present three distinct modeling approaches, each implemented in separate notebooks. Firstly, the "OLINK_NN.ipynb" notebook implements an OLINK neural network model, utilizing the preprocessed data. Secondly, the "Ridge_witholink.ipynb" notebook employs Ridge regression, incorporating features derived from the OLINK preprocessing step. Lastly, the "SVM_Olink.ipynb" notebook introduces a Support Vector Machine model, leveraging the same set of OLINK features. All model notebooks have been updated with the latest code changes as of May 20, 2024. These notebooks collectively offer a comprehensive pipeline for data preprocessing and modeling, facilitating efficient analysis and experimentation. Users can refer to each notebook for detailed implementation, parameter tuning, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, instructions for usage and licensing information are provided for clarity and transparency. We extend our gratitude to all contributors and welcome any inquiries or collaboration opportunities.
